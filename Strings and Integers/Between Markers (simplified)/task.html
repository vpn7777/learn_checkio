<h2>Between Markers (simplified)</h2>
<p>
    You are given a string and two markers (the initial one and final). You have to find a substring enclosed between these two markers. But there are a few important conditions.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial and final markers are always different.</li>
<li>The initial and final markers are always 1 char size.</li>
<li>The initial and final markers always exist in a string and go one after another.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Input: </strong> Three arguments. All of them are strings. The second and third arguments are the initial and final markers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Output: </strong> A string. 
</p>
<div class="for_info_only">
<p>
<strong>Example:</strong>
</p>
<pre class="brush: python">assert between_markers(&quot;What is &gt;apple&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;&quot;) == &quot;apple&quot;
assert between_markers(&quot;What is [apple]&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;) == &quot;apple&quot;
assert between_markers(&quot;What is &gt;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;&quot;) == &quot;&quot;
assert between_markers(&quot;[an apple]&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;) == &quot;an apple&quot;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="for_info_only">
<strong>How it is used: </strong>
<i>For text parsing.</i>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Precondition:</strong>
<i>There can't be more than one final and one initial markers.</i>
